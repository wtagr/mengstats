Welcome to my website. I am a postdoc fellow in the Department of Statistics at the University of Haifa (UH) in Israel, mentored by Prof. [Philip Tzvi Reiss](https://stat.hevra.haifa.ac.il/index.php/en/academic-staff-he/prof-philip-reiss).

Currently I am working on the field of biostatistics including evaluation and measures on data reliability, hypothesis test of difference on distributions and analysis and modeling on fMRI, fNIRs and behavioral data.

I am open to both industrial and academic opportunities.
