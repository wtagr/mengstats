Owing to my supervisor and colleague Jose Miguel and Jose Luis at the University of Granada, for briefly introducing their work about this, a popular idea was kept by myself that how exactly you measure the systematic/general risk for the entire company with multiple businesses. Naive thinking on this could be a weighted summation of all the risks of single businesses, but as our knowledge, it will go wired if we do not carefully consider the dependence/association across the multiple businesses, even if the weights are controlled by these dependencies.\nThen till this year 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 affects all the aspects. Besides the numerous lives lost, the depression of economics would come after that. At least in China, during the state-wide lock-down, it is easy to imagine that lands of small companies could not survive for this period. So do those in other countries and districts. Inspired by several Weibo (Sorry for my short memory, one of those could come from 木遥 probably), the main idea of which talks about the power of the competitive market, for instance, the level of the competitive market reflects that of the efficiency of local authorities to the governance of the corona-virus, and the other is that single sales channel, such as retail or wholesale/B2B, leads to the shortage shock among toilet paper and meat1. The former one may cause the interest of sociologists and economists to study the efficiency of free/competitive market to the governance in view of China’s evidence.\nMotivation The latter one reminds me of the association to the systematical measure of risks, and also it could be akin to the classical Mean-Variance theory in risk management. In other words, the shortage of toilet paper and/or meat in the supermarkets or groceries may result from the imbalance of the supply and demand in the retail, since the companies in these domains are solid on their retail sales channels and have no flows from other channels, such as B2, which currently has affluent supply with no demand due to the lock-down situation. The reason for the ‘no-flow’ situation is the barriers in various channels.\nIn short, one company conducting a single business (sales channel) is the consequence of a less competitive environment and thus stays in a high-risk position systematically. So I am just curious whether the following statement holds or not:\n The less diversification resulting from the less competitive market is in higher systematic risk.\n The front part of this statement is so fascinating to me. Besides its connection to some orthodox Economic theories, it may let me re-think the classical case in the textbook: pouring out milk during the depression – classically considered as the action of the Price war. Now it happens again, not only milk but also some vegetable,2 which would witness more explanations\nBack to the front part, even it is a causal-and-effect problem and must be complicated if imported DAGs, some observations may be useful. A recent work (Ljubownikow and Ang 2020) gives a cool empirical result:\n“… higher competitive intensity is associated with less related diversification and more unrelated diversification…”\nThe related/unrelated diversification also naturally describes the dependence level of the multiple businesses, which hints the association with the structure of the systematic measure of risk. Therefore, this new consideration of the systematic measure of risk would make a difference in corporate risk management.\n Model Yet, if the normative study of Economics is temporarily ignored, the second part of our statement would be easy to check in a simple framework referring to Ljubownikow and Ang (2020) as well: the association among competition, diversification, and systematic risk. The stylized facts of this work would be a good start to some intuition of further normative studies.\n References Feinstein, Zachary, Birgit Rudloff, and Stefan Weber. 2017. “Measures of Systemic Risk.” SIAM Journal on Financial Mathematics 8 (1): 672–708.\n Ljubownikow, Grigorij, and Siah Hwee Ang. 2020. “Competition, Diversification and Performance.” Journal of Business Research 112: 81–94.\n    need citation?↩\n need citation and pic?↩\n  \n","date":1587254400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587254400,"objectID":"6286d5398b6bf59497a965b601c12b72","permalink":"/post/ac-systematic_risk/","publishdate":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/ac-systematic_risk/","section":"post","summary":"A straightforward idea on the study of the systematic risk and the multiple businesses in a view of Corporate Finance inspired by the COVID-19 period.","tags":["Systematic Risk","Diversification","Competitive Market"],"title":"Competition, diversification and systematic risk","type":"post"},{"authors":["Philip Reiss","Meng Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"ae3a8dcc7ea14783525b5b91bab1cbd5","permalink":"/publication/2019-xu-jspi/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-xu-jspi/","section":"publication","summary":"Functional principal component analysis for sparse longitudinal data usually proceeds by first smoothing the covariance surface, and then obtaining an eigendecomposition of the associated covariance operator.

With the advent of new and complex types of data for which the ICC is not defined, there is a need for new ways to assess reliability. To meet this need, we propose a new distance-based intraclass correlation coefficient (dbICC), defined in terms of arbitrary distances among observations. We introduce a bias correction to improve the coverage of bootstrap confidence intervals for the dbICC, and demonstrate its efficacy via simulation. We illustrate the proposed method by analyzing the test-retest reliability of brain connectivity matrices derived from a set of repeated functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. The Spearman-Brown formula, which shows how more intensive measurement increases reliability, is extended to encompass the dbICC.","tags":["Functional connectivity","Intraclass correlation coefficient","Spearman-Brown formula","Test-retest reliability"],"title":"Generalized reliability based on distances","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Meng Xu","Philip Reiss"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"df6c091a935fbd7ba763e6efbcf8c2b4","permalink":"/publication/2019-xu-env/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-xu-env/","section":"publication","summary":"Graphical tests assess whether a function of interest departs from an envelope of functions generated under a simulated null distribution. This approach originated in spatial statistics, but has recently gained some popularity in functional data analysis. Whereas such envelope tests examine deviation from a functional null distribution in an omnibus sense, in some applications we wish to do more: to obtain p-values at each point in the function domain, adjusted to control the familywise error rate. Here we derive pointwise adjusted p-values based on envelope tests, and relate these to previous approaches for functional data under distributional assumptions. We then present two alternative distribution-free p-value adjustments that offer greater power. The methods are illustrated with an analysis of age-varying sex effects on cortical thickness in the human brain.","tags":["Functional connectivity","Functional Data","Graphical tests","Pointwise p-values"],"title":"Distribution-Free Pointwise Adjusted P-Values for Functional Hypotheses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Meng Xu"],"categories":["Travel"],"content":"本想以华丽的辞藻开篇游记系列，奈何文字功底浅薄，仅记录旅行流程，以此纪念；如果能给予你一些帮助，再好不过。随后回更新一些精选照片，以供参考。\n这次旅行从2019年4月18日由以色列出发，同月26日返回，总共8+天时间。\n   日期Date 所在地 航班/交通信息Travel information 住宿Accomodation Remarks     4月18日 伊斯坦布尔 飞抵伊斯坦布尔        洲际    4月19日          洲际    4月20日          洲际    4月21日        以弗所 航班前往伊兹米尔；火车前往以弗所 Livia Hotel Ephesus    4月22日          Livia Hotel Ephesus    4月23日        棉花堡 小巴中转前往棉花堡 Venus Suite Hotel    4月24日        安塔利亚 大巴前往安塔利亚 皇冠    4月25日          皇冠    4月26日  航班中转伊斯坦布尔飞往以色列      特拉维夫       ","date":1574553600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574553600,"objectID":"942c887224cf3a21cd5fb038658415bc","permalink":"/post/uh-turkey/","publishdate":"2019-11-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/uh-turkey/","section":"post","summary":"土耳其2019.04","tags":["Turkey"],"title":"游记流水账其一","type":"post"},{"authors":["Meng Xu"],"categories":["R"],"content":"\n","date":1573948800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573948800,"objectID":"70eee23cca795b5e8dfda08b547c3bc5","permalink":"/post/uh-ucy/","publishdate":"2019-11-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/uh-ucy/","section":"post","summary":"动画和图片","tags":["UH"],"title":"Presentation的究极利器","type":"post"},{"authors":["Meng Xu"],"categories":["Anecdote"],"content":"从去年接到以色列海法大学博士后工作offer，就开始了对海法大学官网的探索。由于offer来自于统计系，当然首先是查找系的主页。凭经验，统计系无非属于自然科学学部(Faculty of Natural Sciences)，或是以生物统计系的名义属于医学部。但海法大学自然科学学部并无统计系，且无医学部，这就令人生疑：难道是设立了独立的统计研究中心或是属于数学系的下属研究室(Section)。逐学部依次检索，在社会科学学部(Faculty of Social Sciences)下发现了统计系：当然，这结果情理之中。但有趣的是，发现计算机系也在列其中——这就意料之外、情理之外了。为何海法大学计算机系属于社会科学学部而非理学部？这样的问题就埋下了。\n时间就到了今天。以享受茶歇和午餐的目的，参加了在海法大学举办的 Israeli Data and Network Science meeting 2019 会议。外行乍一看，和统计系联系应该很深，但是都知道，这都是计算机系和数学系玩儿的。虽然带着打酱油的心，没想到收获丰富——一是 Random Graph 的报告异常有趣，包括六年六篇Nature系列论文加身的大牛分享；二是偶然解答了计算机系为何属于社会科学学部的问题。\n 免费午餐丰盛！\n 用餐时恰好和一位计算机系的退休老教授邻座。在寒暄之后，知道他是在海法大学计算机系做图论相关研究、两次访问了清华大学、熟知北京冬夏空气污染最严重、没听过四川大学……。但可惜忘记了他的名字。闲聊间，偶然间想起了这个困扰已久的问题，遂问之：来之前，看到统计系这类理科性质的学科划分在社会科学学部，尚属情理之中，因为其出身于国家统计、经济统计，但是不知道为什么计算机系也划分在社会科学学部。\n老教授鬼魅一笑，问道：那你现在来了海法，知道为什么吗？答：仍不知。停顿片刻笑说：二十五年前，数学系和计算机系教授们间的关系并不融洽、不和谐。计算机系并不想与数学系同属一个学部，从而搬移至社会科学学部。现在这两帮教授都已经退休了，就无所谓了。\n 恍然大悟\n 后来又谈到，海法大学计算机系、统计系与系统信息系将于今或明年搬迁至 Downtown 新校区，同时组建数据科学学院 (School of Data Science) 。我问到：那你想搬迁到新校区么？答曰：不想。我说：是啊，至少能在山顶校区有一间办公室也好。他说到：如果最后计算机系真搬了，我就转到数学系去，反正他们不搬。\n （笑）\n 当然二十五年前数学系与计算机系间的故事，等下次开数学的会的时候，再找数学系退休老教授八卦吧。\n","date":1562889600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562889600,"objectID":"0e3376c83ee720f6ce7d1f27b4a3feda","permalink":"/post/uh-story1/","publishdate":"2019-07-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/uh-story1/","section":"post","summary":"计算机系属于哪个学部?","tags":["UH"],"title":"海法大学轶事之一","type":"post"},{"authors":["Meng Xu","Jose M.

In this paper, we extend the classical FAR model to address the intrinsic local stationarity of a process through a varying-coefficient (VC) FAR model which characterizes nonconstant dependence between the functional predictors and the functional responses with a time-varying operator. We express the nonparametric models under sieves, whereas the time-varying operator is estimated by a local regression technique. The asymptotic properties of the estimated operator are established in this paper. Our simulation study points to a substantial gain from the VC-FAR modeling as the underlying smooth structural changes can be captured precisely. As an application,weconsider the yield curves of the U.S. government bonds with different maturities. Our proposed model provides a reasonable interpretation of the dynamic transition consistent to the economic events triggering the evolution shifts, and performs more accurately on forecasting actual yield data at both short and long horizons, compared with various standard benchmark forecasts.","tags":["Functional Data","Local Linear","Autoregressive"],"title":"Varying coefficient functional autoregressive model with application to the US treasuries","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Distance-based Intraclass Correlation Coeffcient.\nlibrary(devtools) install_github(\u0026quot;wtagr/dbicc\u0026quot;,force = TRUE) library(dbicc)  ","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"f8d22ebb8aef2b606fdd47398ae58d7a","permalink":"/project/dbicc/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dbicc/","section":"project","summary":"Distance-based Intraclass Correlation Coeffcient.","tags":["R package"],"title":"dbICC","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Difference between Varying Distributions Test.\nrequire(devtools) install_github(\u0026quot;wtagr/DVDtest\u0026quot;, force = TRUE) library(DVDtest)  ","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"834fc1d8139fddfb33c23584515f8cc8","permalink":"/project/dvdtest/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dvdtest/","section":"project","summary":"Difference between Varying Distributions Test.","tags":["R package"],"title":"DVDtest","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"R package for Pointwise adjusted Permutation P-values (PPPvalue).
