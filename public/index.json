Here we consider the use of penalized tensor product splines for the initial smoothing step. Drawing on a result regarding finite-rank symmetric integral operators, we derive an explicit spline representation of the estimated eigenfunctions, and show that the effect of penalization can be notably disparate for alternative approaches to tensor product smoothing. The latter phenomenon is illustrated with two data sets derived from magnetic resonance imaging of the human brain.","tags":["roughness penalty","bivariate smoothing","covariance function"],"title":"Tensor product splines and functional principal components","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Meng Xu"],"categories":["Anecdote"],"content":"从去年接到以色列海法大学博士后工作offer，就开始了对海法大学官网的探索。由于offer来自于统计系，当然首先是查找系的主页。凭经验，统计系无非属于自然科学学部(Faculty of Natural Sciences)，或是以生物统计系的名义属于医学部。但海法大学自然科学学部并无统计系，且无医学部，这就令人生疑：难道是设立了独立的统计研究中心或是属于数学系的下属研究室(Section)。逐学部依次检索，在社会科学学部(Faculty of Social Sciences)下发现了统计系：当然，这结果情理之中。但有趣的是，发现计算机系也在列其中——这就意料之外、情理之外了。为何海法大学计算机系属于社会科学学部而非理学部？这样的问题就埋下了。\n时间就到了今天。以享受茶歇和午餐的目的，参加了在海法大学举办的 Israeli Data and Network Science meeting 2019 会议。外行乍一看，和统计系联系应该很深，但是都知道，这都是计算机系和数学系玩儿的。虽然带着打酱油的心，没想到收获丰富——一是 Random Graph 的报告异常有趣，包括六年六篇Nature系列论文加身的大牛分享；二是偶然解答了计算机系为何属于社会科学学部的问题。\n 免费午餐丰盛！\n 用餐时恰好和一位计算机系的退休老教授邻座。在寒暄之后，知道他是在海法大学计算机系做图论相关研究、两次访问了清华大学、熟知北京冬夏空气污染最严重、没听过四川大学……。但可惜忘记了他的名字。闲聊间，偶然间想起了这个困扰已久的问题，遂问之：来之前，看到统计系这类理科性质的学科划分在社会科学学部，尚属情理之中，因为其出身于国家统计、经济统计，但是不知道为什么计算机系也划分在社会科学学部。\n老教授鬼魅一笑，问道：那你现在来了海法，知道为什么吗？答：仍不知。停顿片刻笑说：二十五年前，数学系和计算机系教授们间的关系并不融洽、不和谐。计算机系并不想与数学系同属一个学部，从而搬移至社会科学学部。现在这两帮教授都已经退休了，就无所谓了。\n 恍然大悟\n 后来又谈到，海法大学计算机系、统计系与系统信息系将于今或明年搬迁至 Downtown 新校区，同时组建数据科学学院 (School of Data Science) 。我问到：那你想搬迁到新校区么？答曰：不想。我说：是啊，至少能在山顶校区有一间办公室也好。他说到：如果最后计算机系真搬了，我就转到数学系去，反正他们不搬。\n （笑）\n 当然二十五年前数学系与计算机系间的故事，等下次开数学的会的时候，再找数学系退休老教授八卦吧。\n","date":1562889600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562889600,"objectID":"0e3376c83ee720f6ce7d1f27b4a3feda","permalink":"/post/uh-story1/","publishdate":"2019-07-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/uh-story1/","section":"post","summary":"计算机系属于哪个学部?","tags":["UH"],"title":"海法大学轶事之一","type":"post"},{"authors":["Meng Xu","Jose M.

First, the sensitivity characteristics of the modified divergence risk measure with respect to profit and loss (P\u0026L) and the reference probability in the penalty term are discussed, in view of the certainty equivalent and robust statistics. Secondly, a similar sensitivity property of (h, $phi$)-divergence risk measure with respect to P\u0026L is shown, and boundedness by the analytic risk measure is proved. Numerical studies designed for Renyi- and Tsallis-divergence risk measure are provided. This new family integrates a wide spectrum of divergence risk measures and relates to divergence preferences.","tags":["Divergence","Risk Measures","Axiom"],"title":"Divergence-Based Risk Measures: A Discussion on Sensitivities and Extensions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Meng Xu","Jialiang Li","Ying Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"7a716499faed93e19acbfa62c8a63576","permalink":"/publication/2017-xu-jmva/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-xu-jmva/","section":"publication","summary":"The functional autoregressive (FAR) model belongs to an important class of models for dependent functional data analysis (FDA) and has been investigated intensively in many applications, especially for modeling the autoregressive dynamics of high-volume time series data. In this paper, we extend the classical FAR model to address the intrinsic local stationarity of a process through a varying-coefficient (VC) FAR model which characterizes nonconstant dependence between the functional predictors and the functional responses with a time-varying operator. We express the nonparametric models under sieves, whereas the time-varying operator is estimated by a local regression technique. The asymptotic properties of the estimated operator are established in this paper. Our simulation study points to a substantial gain from the VC-FAR modeling as the underlying smooth structural changes can be captured precisely. As an application,weconsider the yield curves of the U.S. government bonds with different maturities. Our proposed model provides a reasonable interpretation of the dynamic transition consistent to the economic events triggering the evolution shifts, and performs more accurately on forecasting actual yield data at both short and long horizons, compared with various standard benchmark forecasts.","tags":["Functional Data","Local Linear","Autoregressive"],"title":"Varying coefficient functional autoregressive model with application to the US treasuries","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Distance-based Intraclass Correlation Coeffcient.\nlibrary(devtools) install_github(\u0026quot;wtagr/dbicc\u0026quot;,force = TRUE) library(dbicc)  ","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"f8d22ebb8aef2b606fdd47398ae58d7a","permalink":"/project/dbicc/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dbicc/","section":"project","summary":"Distance-based Intraclass Correlation Coeffcient.","tags":["R package"],"title":"dbICC","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Difference between Varying Distributions Test.\nrequire(devtools) install_github(\u0026quot;wtagr/DVDtest\u0026quot;, force = TRUE) library(DVDtest)  ","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"834fc1d8139fddfb33c23584515f8cc8","permalink":"/project/dvdtest/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dvdtest/","section":"project","summary":"Difference between Varying Distributions Test.","tags":["R package"],"title":"DVDtest","type":"project"}]
