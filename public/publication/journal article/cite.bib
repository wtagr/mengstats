ABSTRACT = {This paper introduces a new family of the convex divergence-based risk measure by specifying     ( h , ϕ )    -divergence, corresponding with the dual representation. First, the sensitivity characteristics of the modified divergence risk measure with respect to profit and loss (P&amp;L) and the reference probability in the penalty term are discussed, in view of the certainty equivalent and robust statistics. Secondly, a similar sensitivity property of     ( h , ϕ )    -divergence risk measure with respect to P&amp;L is shown, and boundedness by the analytic risk measure is proved. Numerical studies designed for R&eacute;nyi- and Tsallis-divergence risk measure are provided. This new family integrates a wide spectrum of divergence risk measures and relates to divergence preferences.},
